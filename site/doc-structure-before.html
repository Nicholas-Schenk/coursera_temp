<!-- All html docs should start with <!DOCTYPE html>. This is largely a historical thing. Back in the day there were non-html-compliant pages.-->
<html>
    <!-- describes the page essentially! contains metadata about the content-->
    <head>
        <!-- Note that meta tag is self-standing!-->
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <title>This tag is required!</title>
    </head>

    <body>
        <p>This contains the body of the HTML!</p>
        <!-- YOU ALWAYS MUST CLOSE CHILD TAGS BEFORE OUTER PARENT TAG (aka close p before body)-->
    </body>
    <!-- HTML is loaded sequentially from the doctype, html tag, head, body, etc. (TOP TO BOTTOM!)-->
</html>
