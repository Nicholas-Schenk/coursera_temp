        <!--inline styling. shouldn't use this as it's not reusable!!-->
        <p style="text-align: center;">We also can specify style directly in the element!(centered) As we can see, all of the paragraphs will have the font family specified in my_css.css, but since the background color is overridden in the header here the background has become aquamarine</p>
        <p style="background-color: blueviolet;"> This paragraph has a background color of blueviolet since it overrides the previous 2 background colors</p>
