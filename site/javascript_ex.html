        <!--To access an element, JS can use the document.getElementById() method-->
        <!--The id attribute defines the HTML elem, the innerHTML property defines the HTML content-->
        <p id="demo"> I'm a paragraph, please don't click that button and kill me!</p>
        <button type="button" onclick="document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML = 'Oof, im dead now :('"> This will change the paragraphs text. </button>


        <!--Document.write may be useful for testing, but it deletes all other existing HTML so not good in practice-->
        <button type="button" onclick="document.write(5+6)"> This will delete all other text </button>

        <!-- window.alert() uses an alert box to display data-->
        <!--Technically dont need window keyword. window refers to global scope object-->
        <button type="button" onclick="window.alert('this is an alert')"> This will show an alert </button>


        <button type="button" onclick="console.log('You clicked the button ya nerd!')"> This log a fun message in the console </button>

        <!--If you wanna print out the webpage, use window.print()-->

        <button type="button" onclick="window.print()"> This will let you print the entire page </button>




        <p>Here's a list of key words in JS: <br>
        break <br>
        continue <br>
        debugger: stops the execution of JS and calls (if available) te debugging function <br>
        do/while <br>
        for <br>
        function (declares a function) <br>
        if/else <br>
        return <br>
        switch <br>
        try/catch <br>
        var: declares a variable. JS is weird.

        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Java script defines 2 type of values: fixed and variable <br>
        Fixed values are called literals, variable values are called variables.</p>

        <br>
        <p>Javascript variables literally have no type, you have to remember what they are! Javascript is type sensitive</p>


        <p>NOw there exists the keywords const: to say that a var cannot be reassigned, and let which defines a variable with restricted scope. A let variable will only have "Block Scope" aka code inside the same {} as it can use it</p>
        <p> You can define many variables in a single statement by using commas</p>
        <p>In JS "undefined" is equivalent to null in other languages</p>
        <p>addition as concactenation: when you add a string and non-strings, they will be combined together to make a string. aka 4+"5" = "45"</p>
        <br>
        <p>You can actually declare variables after you use them because javascript "hoists" these declarations to the top of the code.</p>

        <p> const variables must be assigned a value when they are declared. However, you CAN change the properties of a constant object!!!</p>
