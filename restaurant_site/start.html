                        <p>  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Psyche started life as our entry into the Carnegie Mellon University COVID-19 Innovation Project where we attempted to develop a solution that could help get us and everyone else through the mental health challenges that COVID caused. What we came up with would eventually become <em>Psyche:</em> an app that provides you with fun challenges to help keep you active and keep your mind stimulated. We settled on this idea because our research for the project showed that a large number of college students, including ourselves, experienced a drop in motivation as well as feeling as though they lack control due to the circumstances surrounding the pandemic. We hope the Psyche can help people like you deal with and defeat these feelings!
